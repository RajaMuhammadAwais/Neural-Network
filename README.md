## 🧠 Overview

**NeuralVis** is an interactive, web-based **AI Research Simulator** designed to visualize and demystify complex concepts in **Machine Learning** and **Advanced Mathematics**. Built with a modern React and TypeScript stack, it provides a hands-on environment for exploring the mechanics of various algorithms, from foundational linear regression to cutting-edge transformer models and multivariable calculus.
